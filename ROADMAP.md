# AI for Attendance: Understanding No-Shows in Maternal Virtual Visits

**Project Type**: Portfolio 
**Time Commitment**: ~5–10 hours/week over 24+ weeks  
**Focus Areas**: Simulated healthcare data, NLP text analysis, ML modeling

---

## 🚧 Phase 1: Planning + Setup (Weeks 1–3)
- Finalize project topic: maternal telehealth no-shows
- Include NLP on patient messages
- Outline structured + unstructured data components
- Define fields (visit history, payer type, etc.)
- Define message labels (intent, stress)
- Set up GitHub repo and Jupyter/Colab environment

## 🧹 Phase 2: Data Generation + Cleaning (Weeks 4–7)
- Simulate structured patient data (appointments, demographics)
- Use Faker to create text messages
- Preprocess text (stopwords, lemmatization, tokenization)
- Merge structured and unstructured datasets

**Visuals Planned**:
- Payer type distribution (Bar/Pie Chart)
- Baby age histogram
- Appointment timeline plot
- Missing data heatmap
- Word cloud of message text

## 🤖 Phase 3: Modeling + Evaluation (Weeks 8–12)
- Rule-based + ML baseline models
- Evaluate with accuracy, recall, precision
- Add fairness metrics (Disparate Impact)
- Add SHAP / LIME explainability

**Visuals**:
- Correlation heatmap
- Feature importance bar chart
- Confusion matrix, ROC/AUC curve
- Precision-recall curve

## 📡 Phase 4: NLP Signal Integration (Weeks 13–16)
- Extract terms like “overwhelmed”, “stressed”
- Add features: message length, sentiment, etc.
- Retrain + evaluate combined model

**Visuals**:
- Keyword frequency bar plot
- Message length vs. outcome (box plot)
- Sentiment histogram
- SHAP/LIME summary plots

## 📊 Phase 5: Reporting + Visualization (Weeks 17–19)
- Create no-show rate and risk visualizations
- Build optional dashboard (Streamlit or Looker)
- Draft visual summary or slides

**Dashboards**:
- Weekly no-show line chart
- Payer/referral-based bar chart
- Visit time heatmap
- SHAP force plot for individual cases

## 📝 Phase 6: Final Write-Up + Polish (Weeks 20–24)
- Write final report or summary
- Clean and document code
- Finalize GitHub repo structure:
- Add screenshots, test reproducibility

## 🛡️ Phase 7: Robustness & Defense (Weeks 25–27)
- Use ART’s `SklearnClassifier` wrapper
- Generate adversarial examples (FGSM, HopSkipJump, TextFooler)
- Test performance degradation + SHAP/LIME under attack
- Apply preprocessing defenses (noise injection, squeezing)
